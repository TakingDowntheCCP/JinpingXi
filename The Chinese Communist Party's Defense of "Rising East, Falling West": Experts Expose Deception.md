The slogan of "Rising East, Falling West," proposed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping three years ago, was once widely promoted but has seen little mention by the authorities in recent years. However, a recent article published by CCP media attempts to defend the concept of "Rising East, Falling West." Overseas experts point out that this move may be an attempt by the CCP to stabilize its internal situation and maintain control over external discourse amidst domestic and international challenges. However, due to inherent problems in the CCP's authoritarian system and the West's departure from appeasement policies, the reality is that the Chinese economy is declining while the West is on the rise.

Against the backdrop of structural issues such as weak consumer demand and the bursting of the real estate bubble in the Chinese economy, the CCP's mouthpiece, the "Guangming Daily," published an article titled "Underestimating China Will Not Stop the Trend of Rising East, Falling West" on February 25.

The article argues that while the share of the US GDP in the global economy increased in 2023 and that of China decreased, it would be wrong to conclude that the "China's development prospects are dim" or that the world economic landscape has stopped evolving towards "Rising East, Falling West."

The piece also states that the increase in the share of the US GDP in the world economy is due to inflation leading to higher price levels, coupled with the appreciation of the US dollar, resulting in slower or even negative "nominal growth rates" when GDPs of various countries are converted into US dollars. However, these short-term factors imply that the long-term trend of the decline in the share of developed economies and the rise in the share of emerging and developing economies, as well as the fundamental upward trend of the Chinese economy, will not change.

The term "Rising East, Falling West" was coined by Xi Jinping at the beginning of 2021, asserting that the CCP regime, representing the rise of the East, is counterbalancing the decline of the West, represented by the United States. However, by 2022, the tide had turned against China, as the West successfully navigated the pandemic while the Chinese economy suffered severely. At the end of 2022, after lifting lockdowns, China's economic recovery proved challenging, with deceleration in imports, exports, consumption, and investment, accompanied by a decrease in foreign investment and a surge in youth unemployment. Consequently, there has been widespread pessimism about the Chinese economy.

Sun Guoxiang, a professor at the Department of International Affairs and Business at South China University in Taiwan, views the publication of this article as an internal propaganda effort by the CCP. He argues that since almost all indicators of the Chinese economy are problematic, this will affect the perception of developing countries that cooperate with China, especially those participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. Given the current international situation, the CCP feels the need to stabilize its discourse and thus emphasizes "Rising East, Falling West."


However, over the past two years, Beijing has rarely mentioned "Rising East, Falling West," and several scholars within the system have openly expressed dissent. For example, Fu Mengzi, deputy director of the China Institute of International Studies, and Wang Wen, executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, stated that the trend of "Rising East, Falling West" is slowing down.


Yuan Hongbing, a liberal scholar living in Australia, believes that the article is a product of CCP propaganda and lacks academic credibility. He points out that the CCP media selectively discusses aspects that are favorable to China and unfavorable to the United States. However, the internal turmoil in the Chinese economy has led to a continuous decrease in prices for some goods, which is inconsistent with the normal operation of the economy.


Regarding the future of the Chinese economy, Sun Guoxiang believes that China's economic structure and system have multiple problems that may ultimately lead to major issues with the regime. Historically, authoritarian regimes' economies have faced challenges, and China's economic development has lost the support of international factors and missed strategic development opportunities.


Overall, although the CCP is striving to maintain its outward propaganda, it is unable to address the fundamental issues of economic structure and system. This may lead to economic decline in China, while the West continues to ascend.
