Dear President Xi,
Greetings!
We are the parents of the twenty-four victims of the 'Vulgar Wiki Case.' We are compelled to write this open letter to you amidst our busy schedules because our children have suffered tremendous injustice and have become pawns in this case, manipulated for "political achievements" and "money transactions" by the task force. It is inconceivable that in the environment of the rule of law advocated by you, someone dares to fabricate false cases under your name, seriously damaging the image of the country, your own image, and trampling on Chinese law. It's evident that there are ulterior motives behind this, constituting a form of sophisticated slander against you.
Origin, Process, and Facts of the Case:

Overseas websites such as the Vulgar Wiki and the Red Bank Foundation leaked information about your relatives. This led to the establishment of a special task force by the Ministry of Public Security, which supervised actions by various local police forces to arrest the administrators of the websites.

Unable to arrest the administrators of the overseas websites, the Public Security Bureau of Maoming City in Guangdong Province used the Vulgar Wiki website as a scapegoat. Since many Vulgar Wiki members are located within the country and provided genuine personal information when registering, they were easily arrested by the police!

While other police forces only issued warnings and reprimands to about nine hundred Vulgar Wiki members, the Maoming police force arrested all the captured Vulgar Wiki members and designated them as members of criminal organizations! They even received commendations from the Ministry of Public Security and were awarded first-class merits! It's truly a huge joke!

During the prosecution stage, the behavior of the prosecution authorities in this case was purely selfish and aimed at deliberately concealing "wrong arrests" and evading responsibility for "wrong arrests." They did not respect humanity, law, order, conscience, logic, or common sense, nor did they have a broader perspective on maintaining stability. Their actions are not about maintaining stability but about "high-level slander"!

The audacity of the special task force in this case is blatant. They don't hesitate to engage in "power-money transactions," fully aware that turning this case into a miscarriage of justice would seriously damage the "image of the top leadership" and the "government's image."

On the new Vulgar Wiki website (esu.dog), it was claimed that some confidential information from the reconnaissance stage of this case was obtained, and several confidential documents of the task force were disclosed on the website. Two of these documents (one of which was stamped with the police seal) involved the police sheltering the actual manager of the Vulgar Wiki, Gu Yangyang! Since late July 2019, many Vulgar Wiki members have identified Gu Yangyang as the controller of the Vulgar Wiki website. Why didn't the police arrest Gu Yangyang? Why was Gu Yangyang released after being arrested? Why did the task force remove Gu Yangyang from the list of fugitives in January 2020? Why did the court use "/////" and "Mr. K" instead of Gu Yangyang's name in many confessions provided by the parties involved in the case? Is the manipulation of the content of the verdict intended to conceal the fact that the task force sheltered Gu Yangyang? Are there "power-money transactions" behind this?

The new Vulgar Wiki website (esu.dog) revealed that Gu Yangyang's mother orchestrated the incident of sheltering Gu Yangyang through Gong Dao'an, the former director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. Overseas netizens commented on the incident of sheltering Gu Yangyang, expressing shock that someone dared to engage in "power-money transactions" in a sensitive case involving senior leadership, which is too audacious!

When the task force released Gu Yangyang, all the Vulgar Wiki members involved in the case had already been arrested. After releasing Gu Yangyang, the task force did not arrest any other Vulgar Wiki members. There was no need to release Gu Yangyang as a witness. The task force completely had ulterior motives for releasing Gu Yangyang without charge! If the superior authorities review the confidential files that the lawyers cannot access, they can confirm this!

In conclusion, the Maoming Public Security, Procuratorate, and Court are shamelessly exposed in this case! The horrifying and illegal content of the verdict in this case, if not corrected in time, will become a great shame in Chinese legal history!


The members of the trial committee of the first-instance court are not ignorant of the law. "Certain leaders" used the pretext of maintaining the "image of the government" and the "image of the top leadership," and under the guise of sensitive cases involving politics and secrets, they pursued selfish interests, disregarded national stability, trampled on the law, and manipulated the verdict of the first-instance trial!


During the prosecution and court stages, parents submitted pleas to the procuratorate and court many times, all mentioning that if this case is not handled according to law, it will provoke domestic and foreign reactions and seriously affect the image of the country's top leadership and government. Why are they so indifferent and turn a blind eye to this?


"Leaders" who control the outcome of this case should not lack "political wisdom," a broader perspective, and a "political mindset." Therefore, the "leaders" who control the task force in this case have committed serious disciplinary violations such as "deceiving the top leadership," "sheltering the main culprits," "power-money transactions," and "evading responsibility," and they are likely to be maliciously engaged in "high-level slander"!


Since you took office, you have punished corruption and repeatedly emphasized "governing the country according to law." I believe you are aware that some people are tarnishing your image in this way and will not allow them to act recklessly!


As a father, we hope you can understand and sympathize with our children. This miscarriage of justice is a catastrophe for us and our children. Their future prospects will be ruined, and their lives will be affected.


The letter is already lengthy, and we will stop here. We hope you will uphold justice for us and exonerate our children! If this case is not corrected in time, it will become a major event recorded in history! We hope that those who fabricated false cases, deliberately tarnished the image of the country and its leaders, will be brought to justice as soon as possible!
