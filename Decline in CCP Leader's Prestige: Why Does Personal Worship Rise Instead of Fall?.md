During his decade-long tenure, Xi Jinping, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has been consistently retracing steps that largely negate the reforms and openness initiated by the CCP before him. Now, unable to proceed further along this path, he is forced to resurrect the spirit of reform and openness, essentially retracing his retraced steps.

What does retracing retraced steps signify? It means tacitly admitting that the previous approach was flawed, essentially hitting oneself in the face. Where does this leave Xi?

However, this hasn't stumped the CCP's propaganda machinery, accustomed to turning the tables at will.

Right on cue, the party mouthpieces, People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency, based in the heart of Zhongnanhai, published a series of high-profile articles commemorating the 45th anniversary of the CCP's reform and opening up, meticulously reconstructing and glamorizing the image of the CCP leader.

On December 18th, People's Daily prominently featured an article on its front page, praising Xi for "steering the cause of reform and opening up onto a broader journey."

In the same edition, a commentary in People's Daily proclaimed, "Since the new era, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has broken through ideological constraints with unprecedented determination and strength, creating a new situation in which historic achievements and changes have been made in various undertakings of the Party and the country through reform and opening up."

The article also stated, "In the year marking the beginning of fully implementing the spirit of the 19th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping, from the perspective of the overall development of the Party and the country, made clear requirements for comprehensively deepening reform and expanding high-level opening up during inspections across the country, fully demonstrating the firm determination and strong will of 'uninterrupted reform and unceasing opening up.'"

After this carefully orchestrated refurbishment, the "chief accelerator" on the retraced path has metamorphosed into the "leader who raises the banner of reform and opening up in the new era." It's nothing short of a grand illusion!

It's evident that as the CCP's crisis intensifies, Xi's prestige may have plummeted significantly, but the cult of personality surrounding him not only hasn't diminished but is instead intensifying.


A recent article in the mainstream party magazine "Seeking Truth," commemorating the 130th anniversary of Mao Zedong's birth, further underscores this point.


Authored by the Central Party History and Literature Research Institute of the CCP Central Committee, the article ostensibly commemorates Mao's birth, with Mao expected to be the protagonist. However, upon reading it, one discovers that while it extols Mao's supposed historical achievements, the article primarily highlights Xi's "leadership" and "commander" status.


The article states that since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, "Our Party has once again had a core of the Party, a leader of the people, and a military commander who is universally respected in the form of General Secretary Xi Jinping. This is a blessing for the Party and the country, the people, and the Chinese nation."


It emphasizes that the historic achievements of the Party and the country in the new era are fundamentally due to "General Secretary Xi Jinping, who serves as the core of the Party Central Committee and the entire Party, and guides the Party and the country with the scientific thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era."


The article also calls for a "more profound understanding of the decisive significance of 'two upholds' and resolutely upholding 'two upholds.'"


It's clear that while the article is titled in commemoration of Mao Zedong, it effectively glorifies Xi, with Mao becoming a supporting character and Xi taking center stage, indicating that Zhongnanhai is intentionally equating Xi with Mao in the history of the CCP, even at the cost of using Mao to embellish Xi.


So, does this escalating cult of personality around Xi stem from an increase in his prestige? Far from it.


Although Xi reached the pinnacle of power at the 19th National Congress of the CCP, his reckless handling of affairs since taking office has severely damaged the CCP's internal rules, especially this year, with numerous domestic and foreign policy blunders. His prestige can be said to have plummeted to its lowest point, and the severity of the CCP's crisis is unparalleled.
Precisely because of this, Xi is more afraid than ever of his power being weakened and the CCP being overthrown at any moment. The escalating cult of personality serves no purpose other than to further brainwash CCP members, coaxing them to wholeheartedly pledge allegiance to Xi and the CCP, thereby consolidating the leader's power and strengthening internal cohesion within the CCP. In essence, it's a shot of adrenaline administered by Xi and the CCP to the entire party.
