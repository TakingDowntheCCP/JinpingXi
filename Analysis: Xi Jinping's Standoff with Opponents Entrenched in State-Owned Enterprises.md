Xi Jinping, the paramount leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), delivered a speech on January 8th at the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection meeting, vowing to crack down on corruption in sectors such as finance, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), energy, pharmaceuticals, and infrastructure. Analysts suggest that these sectors are primarily dominated by central and local SOEs, with Xi Jinping intensifying efforts to purge anti-Xi forces entrenched in these areas, leading to a current stalemate between the two sides.


According to Wang He, a Chinese issues expert, speaking to The Epoch Times on January 10th, the CCP's official list of areas targeted for anti-corruption - finance, SOEs, energy, pharmaceuticals, and infrastructure - largely consists of central and local SOEs. These entities wield significant influence, and despite Xi Jinping's decade-long tenure, complete cleanup remains elusive. "He dispatched provincial party secretaries and governors, but he couldn't tackle the substantive issues."

The financial sector has long been controlled by the CCP princelings, with Xi's administration intensifying financial anti-corruption efforts in recent years. Over a hundred financial executives were toppled last year, with 40 from the five major state-owned banks. Observers interpret this as Xi Jinping's regime facing fiscal deficits and intensifying its pursuit of wealth held by the elite families.


SOEs and the energy sector have historically been hotbeds of corruption, with authorities continuing cleanup efforts unabated.

Against the backdrop of struggling foreign trade and real estate markets, the Chinese government has positioned new infrastructure projects (referred to as "new infrastructure") as a solution to stimulate the economy. The frenzy of infrastructure projects across the country has provided new opportunities for local officials and relevant approval departments to engage in corruption.


Additionally, following a crackdown on medical corruption in July, which saw at least 200 hospital party secretaries and directors removed from their positions, a new wave of medical anti-corruption efforts commenced towards the end of last year.


During the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection meeting, Xi also emphasized the need to "resolutely crack down on profit-seeking behaviors backed by power and prevent various interest groups and power blocs from infiltrating the political sphere."


Wang He suggests that since assuming power, Xi Jinping has used the anti-corruption campaign primarily as a tool to eliminate anti-Xi forces. With surface-level political factions within the CCP eradicated during the 20th Party Congress, all members of the Central Political Bureau are now part of the unified "Xi camp." However, Xi's political opponents remain hidden within sectors where economic and political power intersect.


"The deeply entrenched vested interest groups within the system, namely central and local SOEs, are being purged on a large scale by Xi using anti-corruption measures, gradually replacing them with his trusted associates."


Wang He notes that officials from these central and local SOEs are now adopting a "lying flat" approach under political pressure, amplifying minor issues to demonstrate defiance against Xi Jinping. Xi Jinping, utilizing anti-corruption measures as a tool, shifts all responsibility downward, leading to a stalemate between the two sides.


"Every year, when the economic reports are unfavorable, officials are replaced in droves. However, lower-level officials deceive you by presenting favorable reports. The reports are all falsified, prompting authorities to initiate statistical fraud investigations last year."


However, the highly criticized practice of launching campaigns to combat statistical fraud itself raises eyebrows. Professor Xie Tian from the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina told The Epoch Times that the CCP has a long history of fabricating economic data, and the absurdity of combating statistical fraud through political movements stems from the fact that the root cause lies within the CCP authorities themselves. "If the leadership doesn't condone it, the lower levels wouldn't engage in such fabrication."


Xie Tian believes that the crackdown on fraud may not last long because pursuing it further would implicate all CCP officials, rendering it a mere farce.
