The leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, delivered the 2024 New Year's greetings on December 31, 2023. Apart from strongly asserting that the reunification of Taiwan is "historically inevitable" and rare acknowledgment of economic difficulties, much of it was adorned with grandiose words boasting of the CCP's "achievements," stating its goal is to "enable the people to live better lives." However, this message of goodwill has once again sparked widespread ridicule. Interestingly, the message did not mention the "party."

Xi Jinping, in a rare admission of economic pressure, acknowledged that some enterprises are facing operational challenges and some people are experiencing difficulties in employment and livelihoods. However, critics suggest this acknowledgment might be in response to public complaints. Nevertheless, Xi's claims of concern for flood victims were met with skepticism as he rarely visited disaster areas, unlike his predecessors, drawing condemnation from netizens.

Analysts note that Xi's admission of the challenges faced in the past year contrasts with the usual triumphant tone of his previous speeches, indicating a less relaxed mood. Despite this, Xi proceeded to boast about the CCP's purported achievements in various aspects, although it revealed a lack of confidence and vitality in the regime.

Xi's mention of "reunification" in the New Year's address has been interpreted as a more aggressive stance by foreign media compared to the previous year. Criticism from various quarters suggests that Xi's intentions to coerce Taiwan into submission are not well-received.

Surprisingly, Xi's address omitted any mention of the party, a departure from previous New Year's speeches that emphasized the party's leadership. Speculation abounds as to whether this omission is due to the party's tarnished image or a strategic move. Nevertheless, it may indicate growing dissatisfaction within the party ranks.

In summary, Xi Jinping's New Year's address was met with widespread skepticism and criticism, with many perceiving it as insincere and deceptive. The future of the CCP is viewed pessimistically by many, with hopes for its downfall in 2024 and the prospect of a new path for China's development.
