For the past three weeks, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang has vanished from public view, missing several important diplomatic events and sparking speculation. Qin Gang, handpicked by Xi Jinping, holds a crucial position, and any issues arising with him could potentially embarrass Xi Jinping.

According to records from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, Qin Gang was last seen in public on June 25th, where he met with officials from Sri Lanka, Russia, and Vietnam. His absence has raised concerns, especially after the sudden cancellation of a planned meeting between Qin Gang and the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell.

Although the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, cited "health reasons" for Qin Gang's absence from the ASEAN meeting, this explanation has been met with skepticism. Drew Thompson, a former U.S. defense department official responsible for China affairs, remarked that Beijing's lack of transparency regarding Qin Gang's disappearance could pose a greater challenge for understanding the Chinese government's decisions.

Qin Gang is considered a close ally of Xi Jinping, and his sudden disappearance is particularly sensitive. Promoted to Foreign Minister last year, he was seen as one of Xi Jinping's trusted deputies. However, his sudden absence suggests that Xi Jinping may have made errors in selecting his cadre.

Despite the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs attributing Qin Gang's disappearance to "health reasons," doubts persist. Moreover, rumors regarding Qin Gang's personal life have circulated widely on social media, which is unusual given the strict control typically exercised over such matters by high-ranking Chinese officials.

When asked about these rumors, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Hua Chunying, stated that she was "not aware of the situation." Qin Gang's disappearance has attracted attention both domestically and internationally, potentially putting Xi Jinping in an uncomfortable position as issues arise with one of his trusted allies, leading to questions about his political decisions.
