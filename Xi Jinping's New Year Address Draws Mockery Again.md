Xi Jinping, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered his 2024 New Year address on December 31, 2023. Apart from assertively stating that the reunification of Taiwan is "historically inevitable" and acknowledging economic difficulties, he mostly used grandiose language to extol the CCP's "achievements," claiming that its goal is to "improve the lives of the people." However, this address once again sparked widespread mockery, especially as it omitted any mention of the "party."

Xi's rare admission of economic pressure and his self-proclaimed concern for the people faced criticism. He acknowledged the challenges faced by some businesses and individuals, as well as the natural disasters affecting certain regions. However, commentators suggested that this acknowledgment might be in response to public complaints. The economic downturn, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has left many sectors struggling, despite Xi's claims of concern.

Commentators noted a shift in tone compared to previous years, where Xi's rhetoric often exuded confidence. This year, he spent several paragraphs boasting about the CCP's supposed achievements, using rhetorical devices to emphasize their accomplishments. However, this still hinted at a lack of confidence within the leadership.

In recent years, Xi Jinping's New Year addresses often emphasized China's economic prosperity. However, with the economy experiencing significant challenges, Xi notably avoided mentioning the GDP figures. China's manufacturing sector has shown signs of weakness, with frequent instances of financial turmoil in the real estate market and record-high youth unemployment rates.

Xi's mention of "unification" regarding Taiwan was interpreted as a further hardening of stance by foreign media outlets. Some criticized Xi's aspirations, considering him a dictator trying to subjugate Taiwan under communist rule. Others expressed skepticism about Xi's ability to deliver on his promises, given the internal power struggles within the CCP.

Surprisingly, Xi's address did not mention the party, which raised questions among observers. Some speculated whether this omission was due to the negative connotations associated with the CCP or an attempt to distance the leadership from the party's image. However, regardless of the reason, it hinted at internal dissatisfaction within the party ranks.

Critics slammed Xi's address, labeling it as full of empty rhetoric and lies. They pointed out the stark contrast between his words and the reality faced by many Chinese citizens, with economic hardships persisting and promises unfulfilled. Some compared Xi's leadership to historical tyrants, suggesting that his actions contradict his lofty words.


Amidst widespread public dissatisfaction, there is a growing hope for the downfall of the CCP in 2024. Observers anticipate increased internal turmoil, economic decline, and further isolation on the international stage for China. As dissent among the populace grows, there is a belief that the foundation of CCP's rule may be shaken in the coming year.
