As we step into 2024, overseas observers are turning their attention to the political landscape in China. Feng Chongyi, a Chinese scholar based in Australia, believes that with the bleak outlook for China's economic recovery and escalating youth unemployment, civil discontent could intensify. Xi Jinping, caught in a web of domestic and international challenges, may resort to scapegoating trusted allies, potentially igniting internal upheaval. The possibility of both civil unrest and political upheaval in 2024 looms large, a fact not lost on the authorities, leaving them on edge.


Economic Downturn and Youth Unemployment Fuel Societal Discontent

Speaking in an interview with The Epoch Times on January 2nd, Feng Chongyi, Associate Professor at the University of Technology Sydney, expressed skepticism about any prospects for China's economic turnaround in 2024. He emphasized that the ongoing economic downturn has deeply wounded Chinese livelihoods, particularly among the youth who struggle to find employment, fueling their resentment.

Since August 2023, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics ceased publishing youth unemployment rates, with the last reported figure in July soaring to a historic high of 21.3%. Despite a series of economic data releases by the bureau on December 15th, youth unemployment rates remained conspicuously absent.

Faced with mounting youth unemployment, many Chinese youths have adopted a "lying flat" approach over the past year, notably relying on their parents for financial support. However, Feng Chongyi suggests that as circumstances evolve, this trend may change.


"The mode of resistance used to be passive, lying flat. But lying flat requires certain conditions; if I'm not working, but can still support myself and have savings to live on."


He further notes that as the economic situation fails to improve and people exhaust their savings, simply lying flat becomes untenable, leading to diverse forms of resistance emerging within society.


"With dwindling resources and worsening livelihoods, social discontent will become more widespread, and resistance will take various forms."


Tightening Grip of State Security: "Nation Without Governance"

Recent statements from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Public Security signal an intensified crackdown on grassroots resistance. The Ministry of State Security's rare intervention in economic management and the issuance of a nationwide secrecy checklist further underscore the tightening grip of state security.


Feng Chongyi argues that Xi Jinping's regime's reliance on state security apparatus reflects a nation devoid of effective governance.


"We see the Minister of State Security directly participating in economic work conferences, increased crackdowns on grassroots resistance, and even economists being silenced for criticizing China's economy. The National Bureau of Statistics cannot publish unemployment data, indicative of the dysfunctionality of normal state institutions. This indicates that the country is not functioning according to normal institutional mechanisms but is being governed through surveillance tactics."


He suggests that the establishment of urban management forces, agricultural management teams, and the Central Department of Social Work to prevent grassroots resistance will exacerbate social conflicts. "The intensity of conflicts between officials and the public will escalate this year."


Feng Chongyi previously argued that for change to occur in China, civil unrest, military revolt, and political upheaval must resonate with each other.


On January 2nd, he told The Epoch Times that while it's difficult to predict whether there will be nationwide protests this year, localized resistance is inevitable. "There will be sparks everywhere, but whether they will ignite and form a nationwide trend, we don't know."


Scapegoating and Internal Discord: Tumult in the Inner Sanctum

Regarding the possibility of political upheaval, Feng Chongyi suggests that new conflicts may arise within official circles in response to emerging grassroots conflicts.


"Last year, we saw disappearances of numerous high-ranking officials from the Rocket Force, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of National Defense. This year, we can expect even greater upheaval, with even higher-ranking individuals disappearing. We don't know the specifics, but there will be turbulence in the inner sanctum of Zhongnanhai."


He analyzes that internal power struggles within Xi's inner circle and executions of subordinates might commence. As Xi seeks scapegoats to shoulder blame and punishment, his trusted allies may become disgruntled over time, leading to internal discord and potential upheaval.


"With internal and external pressures mounting, Xi will look for scapegoats. But some individuals may resist being scapegoated. Those who were once his enforcers, benefiting from expanding their power, may continue to do so. However, if they're slated to take the fall, they might resist, potentially leading to turmoil within the inner circle and beyond."

Unpredictable Times Ahead: Xi Jinping on Tenterhooks

During a meeting of the CCP Political Bureau on December 21st to 22nd, 2023, Xi Jinping stressed the importance of preventing and resolving political risks, and promptly addressing political hazards to prevent non-political risks from transforming into political ones.


Feng Chongyi observes that from official statements, it's evident that the regime anticipates the need to prevent non-political events from evolving into political ones.


"Non-political events encompass a wide range - such as stock market crashes, real estate crises - economic and social issues are considered non-political. Political events refer to movements like the Blank Paper Revolution, which directly target Xi Jinping and the CCP, calling for their ouster."


He contends that Xi Jinping aims to prevent non-political protests from transforming into political movements, akin to preventing a color revolution. However, when the moment of regime change arrives, and widespread protests erupt, they may prove uncontrollable.


"The CCP's regime is one of the few remaining authoritarian regimes in the world. Back in '89 during the Tiananmen Square protests, there were still old-guard leaders like Deng Xiaoping, the regime still had its strength, and people harbored illusions about the government. But now, none of these conditions hold true. If another color revolution occurs, the CCP will be overthrown, and the goal of ousting Xi and eradicating the CCP will be achieved. So, one can imagine Xi Jinping is sitting on tenterhooks."
