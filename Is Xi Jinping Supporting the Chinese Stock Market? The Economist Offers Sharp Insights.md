For some time now, the Chinese stock market has been experiencing a sharp decline. On February 8th, The Economist published an article titled "Has Xi Jinping lost control of the markets?" with an image depicting the Chinese leader holding up a plummeting stock market curve with both hands, entangled and bound by the downward curve.

The Economist may have provided a sharp answer to whether Xi can support the Chinese stock market.

The article points out that the Chinese stock market has been tumultuous for investors this year. In January alone, the markets in China and Hong Kong collectively lost $1.5 trillion, while during the same period, the US market rose by 14%, and the Indian market surged by 60%.


Undoubtedly, the overall situation of the Chinese economy is bleak. Compared to the peak reached in 2021, the combined market value of Chinese and Hong Kong stocks has evaporated by $7 trillion, a drop of about 35%. This demonstrates a fundamental problem in Beijing: domestic and foreign investors once considered the Chinese government a reliable economic steward, but now that trust has all but disappeared, bringing serious consequences for China's growth.

The Economist points out that foreign investors no longer favor China. Not only do they have to contend with the Chinese government's poor policy-making, but they also face investment risks arising from deteriorating US-China relations. In recent months, foreign investors have been net sellers of Chinese stocks.

Most concerning is that Chinese investors themselves have lost confidence. The wealth of affluent individuals and their financial investments are declining, and much Chinese capital is flowing out of the country. Those who cannot circumvent China's capital controls are turning to safer money market funds or pouring into funds listed in China that track foreign stocks.

Beijing's series of market rescue measures, such as replacing the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, implementing short-selling bans, and requiring state-owned assets managers to buy Chinese stocks, can only temporarily support the stock market.

The Economist analyzes that Xi Jinping seems to know there's a problem. Apart from dismissing the chairman of the commission, he has also restricted short-selling and ordered state-owned asset managers to purchase Chinese stocks. While this move may temporarily support Chinese stock prices, such intervention only exposes China's (the CCP's) lack of trust in the market, highlighting the reasons for investor exodus.

The article concludes by stating that Beijing needs to rethink the role of the state in the economy, but Xi Jinping is unlikely to relax control. Investors, knowing they cannot escape political issues, will become even more apprehensive.
