Today, overseas media are widely circulating news that Xi Jinping is brewing a major military move. What is this "strange move"? At present, it is still unknown. I do not want to make any comments on this.
On September 13, I published an article on The Epoch Times titled "Where Do Xi Jinping's Nine Decision-Making Errors Come From?" Today, I will talk about nine more major decision-making errors made by Xi and their roots.
Decision to retain three key members of the Jiang faction. In terms of the personnel arrangements of the current CCP leaders, Xi made a decision to retain three key members of the Jiang faction: Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, and Han Zheng.

Zhao Leji serves as a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee and Chairman of the National People's Congress; Wang Huning serves as a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee and Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Han Zheng serves as Vice President of the country.

The Jiang faction, led by Jiang Zemin and Zeng Qinghong, is also known as the "blood debt gang" that persecuted Falun Gong.

Since Jiang Zemin launched the persecution of Falun Gong on July 20, 1999, to force Falun Gong practitioners to abandon their belief in "Truthfulness, Compassion, Forbearance," he spared no means, regardless of cost, and without considering consequences.

The most evil part of it is the large-scale organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners, which is called "the most unprecedented evil on this planet."

This is the bloodiest, most brutal massacre since the Nazi massacre of Jews in the 1930s.

Jiang Zemin, Zeng Qinghong, and other members of the Jiang faction all have blood on their hands from Falun Gong practitioners.


Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, and Han Zheng are all key members of the "blood debt gang" that persecuted Falun Gong led by Jiang and Zeng.


Falun Gong is not just an ordinary qigong but a Buddhist practice. Throughout history, persecuting Buddhism has been a heinous crime.


In May and June 2020, when the pandemic was spreading across China and the world, Zhao Leji deployed the persecution of Falun Gong twice. This shows that Zhao Leji is extremely evil and guilty.


As the "chief intellectual" promoted and valued by Jiang and Zeng, Wang Huning provided "theoretical" support for the persecution of Falun Gong by Jiang and Zeng.


Wang Huning was called the "most dangerous man in the world" by the famous American media personality Hugh Hewitt. In my opinion, Wang Huning is the biggest traitor in the current "Zhongnanhai."


Han Zheng is the most important accomplice of Jiang and Zeng in persecuting Falun Gong in Shanghai.


Xi's retention of Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, and Han Zheng will only lead the CCP's domestic and foreign policies to slide into the abyss.


2. Decision-making regarding the appointment of senior military officers. This is particularly evident in Xi's appointments of Li Shangfu (General), Li Yuchao (General), Xu Zhongbo (General), Liu Guangbin (Major General), and Zhang Zhenzhong (Major General).


Li Shangfu was appointed as a member of the Central Military Commission, State Councilor, and Minister of National Defense in March of this year.


However, by August 30, Li Shangfu had "disappeared."


On September 15, former mainland media person Zhao Lanjian revealed to The Epoch Times that Li Shangfu was arrested on September 1. Subsequently, 8 people from the Equipment Development Department of the Central Military Commission were arrested, including 6 deputy department-level officials and 2 bureau-level officials. These 8 people were all identified by Li Shangfu.


Li Shangfu previously served as Minister of the Equipment Development Department of the Central Military Commission.


On September 22, Reuters reported that Li Shangfu's disappearance was the latest case in the recent mysterious disappearances of high-ranking officials accompanying Xi Jinping. Ten informed sources said that Li Shangfu is under investigation for corruption in military equipment procurement.


In other words, Li Shangfu, who was promoted and valued by Xi as one of the leaders of the CCP, the military, and the state, was investigated for corruption less than half a year after his appointment.


On July 31, Xi Jinping conferred the rank of General on Wang Houbin, Commander of the Rocket Force, and Xu Xisheng, Political Commissar of the Rocket Force, at the Bayi Building in Beijing.


This indicates that the former Commander of the Rocket Force and General Li Yuchao, and the former Political Commissar of the Rocket Force and General Xu Zhongbo, have been removed from their positions.


Li Yuchao was promoted and valued by Xi as the Commander of the Rocket Force, promoted to the rank of General in just a year and a half, and "elected" as a member of the 20th Central Committee for only 9 months before being removed from office; Xu Zhongbo was promoted and valued by Xi as the Political Commissar of the Rocket Force, promoted to the rank of General in just 3 years, and "elected" as a member of the Central Committee for only 9 months before being removed from office.


Why were Generals Li and Xu removed from office? According to reports from domestic and foreign media, they were investigated for corruption.


Liu Guangbin, the Deputy Commander of the Rocket Force promoted and valued by Xi, and Zhang Zhenzhong, former Deputy Commander of the Rocket Force and current Deputy Chief of Staff of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission, were also investigated for corruption.


The Rocket Force is the newest military branch with the highest technological content established by Xi's military reform in 2015. It is in charge of launching short-range, medium-range, long-range, and intercontinental missiles carrying conventional or nuclear weapons, and is the ace military force for strategic deterrence against Taiwan, the United States, and other countries in the world.


The selection and appointment of the Commander, Political Commissar, and Deputy Commander of the Rocket Force should be very cautious, selecting the best from the best, politically reliable, and trustworthy.


However, Generals Li and Xu were taken down shortly after being promoted and valued by Xi. This shows that there are serious problems in Xi's recognition, selection, and use of people.


Dennis Wilder, former senior expert on China military affairs at the Central Intelligence Agency, said, "If the Minister of National Defense and the leaders of the Rocket Force were dismissed due to corruption, it shows serious flaws in Xi Jinping's selection process for senior officials, and it also indicates that despite Xi Jinping's ten-year anti-corruption campaign, corruption is still widespread within the system."


3. Decision to establish the "Xiong'an New Area." On April 1, 2017, Xinhua News Agency, China Central Television, and others jointly released news about the establishment of a national-level "Xiong'an New Area" in Xiongxian, Rongcheng, and Anxin, Hebei Province.


According to the report, this is a major historic strategic choice made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core.


However, this decision is wrong.


Xiong'an New Area is located in the "Nine Rivers Entering the Sump," which should be used as a flood discharge area instead of a new area.


4. Decision of "State Advance, Private Retreat." On June 20, 2020, the China National Textile and Apparel Council issued a statement calling on all member companies to sign the "Letter of Commitment on Not Laying Off Workers Easily" in response to the "State Advance, Private Retreat" policy advocated by Xi Jinping.


On June 23, the State Council issued "Several Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of Private Enterprises in the New Era," calling for efforts to promote the transformation and upgrading of private enterprises and create a better business environment.


The "State Advance, Private Retreat" policy is a major decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to promote the healthy development of the economy.


However, this decision is wrong.


5. Decision to amend the term limit of the Constitution. In March 2018, the National People's Congress passed a constitutional amendment, removing the term limit for the presidency, which means that Xi Jinping can remain in office indefinitely.


This decision is wrong.


6. Decision to end the "One Country, Two Systems" in Hong Kong 27 years ahead of schedule. In June 2020, the National People's Congress passed the "Hong Kong National Security Law," which marks the end of Hong Kong's autonomy and freedom.


This decision is wrong.


7. Decision of the "Belt and Road Initiative." The "Belt and Road Initiative" proposed by Xi Jinping brings a series of problems, including erosion of national sovereignty, opaque contracts, unsustainable debt, etc., leading many countries to demand debt relief.


This decision is wrong.


8. Decision of the "Great Money Throwing." Xi Jinping's massive increase in foreign aid funds ignores domestic poverty and economic problems, leading to internal and external imbalances.


This decision is wrong.


9. Decision of the "Community of Shared Future for Mankind." Xi Jinping proposed to build a "Community of Shared Future for Mankind," but the CCP does not recognize universal values, making this decision meaningless.


In summary, Xi Jinping's decision-making errors stem from ignoring objective laws and disregarding the interests of the Chinese people. Only by conforming to objective laws can correct decisions be made; otherwise, serious consequences will result.
