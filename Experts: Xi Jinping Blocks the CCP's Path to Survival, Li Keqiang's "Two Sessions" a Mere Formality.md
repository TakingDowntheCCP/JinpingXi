With the upcoming sessions of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), attention is drawn to the performance of Premier Li Keqiang, who took office in March last year, amidst political purges and economic crises. Experts believe that Li Keqiang lacks actual power and will merely go through the motions at the sessions, while Xi Jinping's disregard for human nature and his destructive economic policies have blocked the CCP's path to survival.

Over the years, the government work report delivered by the CCP premier has been considered a centerpiece, and observers are keen to see how Li Keqiang will outline plans to salvage the economy.

In January, Li Keqiang claimed at Davos that China's economy grew by around 5.2% last year, a figure also released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. However, international experts widely question its accuracy.

Wang Juntao, Chairman of the China Democracy Party National Committee, told Epoch Times on February 28 that Li Keqiang faces immense challenges in his future economic work, and there will be nothing noteworthy in the government report during the sessions. With Xi Jinping in power, Li Keqiang is merely going through the motions.

"Because Xi Jinping has a set of unrealistic and inhumane economic ideas, similar to Mao Zedong's. Li Keqiang will definitely have to follow Xi's ideas in economic matters, which might not turn out well. However, if Li Keqiang tries to implement his own ideas, Xi Jinping won't accept them, as they wouldn't reflect Xi's leadership as bringing significant progress and change to China."

In the past year, despite claims by Beijing authorities to support private enterprises and retain foreign capital, they have also implemented revised anti-spy laws, and the Ministry of State Security has repeatedly stepped onto the stage to intimidate various sectors. Amid economic downturn, the authorities have also demanded the singing of the "Bright Economic Theory." Wang Juntao believes that Xi Jinping is actually destroying the economy while forcibly painting a rosy picture.


"Clearly, the situation is very bad, but they have to put on a brave face and say everything is fine. He says 'the scenery is unique here,' but in fact, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, China's stock market has been a mess, while stock markets around the world have been doing well. The Chinese people are well aware of this and are very dissatisfied with him (Xi), and basically no one is optimistic about China's economy."


Wang Juntao believes that Xi Jinping's days ahead will be even tougher because he now realizes that people have lost confidence in the economy. People know that Xi Jinping is destroying China's entire economy and future.


Handling Cronies Unfavorable to Xi is a Bad Omen, Li Keqiang Lacks Real Power and Stays Out of the Picture


Since last year, there has been turmoil in the top leadership, with two state councillors, Qin Gang and Li Shangfu, suddenly removed from Li Keqiang's cabinet, a move unseen in the history of the CCP's governance.


Wang Juntao said that in reality, the Premier of the State Council has no personnel power, and the power to form a cabinet lies with Xi Jinping. Even if Qin Gang and Li Shangfu had not been removed, they would not have obeyed Li Keqiang's orders. Therefore, this matter has little impact on Li Keqiang, who remains aloof, but it dealt a heavy blow to Xi Jinping.


"2023 was supposed to be Xi Jinping's year, as he has been in power for ten years, although there were two emperors above him (Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao), both of whom actually had to listen to him. After the National People's Congress last year, he truly gained control of the party and government, and the power became absolutely his."


Wang Juntao said that Xi Jinping's third term was supposed to be a time for significant action, but unexpectedly, he encountered significant trouble in various aspects. People like Li Shangfu and Qin Gang were all promoted by Xi himself, especially Qin Gang, who was promoted out of turn, but in the end, Xi himself removed them, which is a very unfavorable sign for Xi.


Li Keqiang became Premier after the chaotic period of the pandemic lockdowns. Perhaps due to serious economic issues, compared to his predecessors, Li Keqiang spent more of his first year focusing on domestic issues and reduced diplomatic affairs. The Epoch Times found that Wen Jiabao visited 7 countries in his first year in office, Li Keqiang visited 9 countries in his first year, while Li Keqiang only visited 5 countries.


Wang Juntao said that Li Keqiang lacks power in diplomacy; all the power is in Xi Jinping's hands. Even if Li Keqiang goes abroad, he is just executing some of Xi Jinping's instructions. Li Keqiang not only lacks real power, but he has also had much of his authority in foreign affairs taken away by Wang Yi, who reports directly to Xi Jinping.


Chinese Sentiments Dramatically Shift, Xi Jinping Blocks the CCP's Path to Survival


Under the guise of extensive investigations, Li Keqiang spent more time "inspecting" various regions after taking office. However, a recent grassroots survey conducted by Wuhan University professor Lv Dewen, reflecting the plight of grassroots society in mainland China, was quickly suppressed after being published in mainland media.


In the past year, repression of human rights in China has become increasingly severe, and malicious incidents have occurred frequently in society, but official censorship has become stricter. In the past, Wen Jiabao could visit the letters and calls office to meet petitioners, and Li Keqiang, when unexpectedly stopped by petitioners in local areas, could communicate with them immediately. However, after becoming Premier, Li Keqiang has not engaged with petitioners. Against this backdrop, over the past year, there have been subtle changes in the attitudes of Chinese officials and people.


Recently, Pierre-Antoine Donnet, former chief editor of AFP's central office, contacted and interviewed a woman familiar with the CCP's political situation. In a mainstream French magazine, he disclosed various internal situations in China, indicating that "everyone feels scared and is no longer trusted"; the financial crisis has left one-fifth of officials outside Beijing unable to receive salaries.


The informant said that from deputy ministers to children of high-level leaders at all levels, either have left China or are preparing to leave. From street sweepers and taxi drivers to the highest levels of power, no one knows which direction things will go, and this kind of despair is at least unheard of in the past thirty years.


The informant also revealed: criticism of Xi Jinping is everywhere, and China seems to be "a pressure cooker that could explode at any moment."


Wang Juntao, who has many sources of information in mainland China, said that from what he knows, Chinese sentiments toward Xi Jinping are indeed becoming increasingly disappointed, even desperate, viewing Xi Jinping as shameless.
"If God wants him to perish, he must make him go mad. In history, such dynasties have been very arrogant and domineering for a period of time before they collapse. Rights-defending lawyers hope that China can progress, but ultimately, rights are still in the hands of the current system. Now they feel hopeless, which precisely indicates that Xi Jinping has objectively blocked any way for the Communist Party to revive."
