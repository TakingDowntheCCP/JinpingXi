Since the 18th National Congress, Xi Jinping has attended the National Day reception every year, but only spoke during the "fifth year (2014) and the tenth year (2019)", with other years featuring speeches by the Premier. This year, "neither the fifth nor the tenth" (the 74th anniversary of the CCP's founding), Xi made a departure from tradition by giving a speech, looking solemn and somewhat weary. The new Premier Li Qiang was sidelined.

Xi's speeches are just clich√©s. This indicates that Xi's intention is not about what he says but rather about the act of speaking itself. Why did Xi break tradition and choose this form? We have to start with the rapidly deteriorating situation since the 19th National Congress.

Firstly, the economy is facing turmoil. Despite surviving the peak of the pandemic, hopes for economic recovery were dashed as crises such as fluctuating exports, a shattered real estate market, plummeting stock markets, currency depreciation, over 20% youth unemployment, and high local government debt risks emerged. The economic situation is even riskier than during the sudden outbreak of the pandemic in 2020.

Secondly, the international situation is challenging. Events like the "balloon" incident at the end of January and the executive orders issued by Biden in August (prohibiting, restricting, and supervising U.S. investors in specific areas such as semiconductors, microelectronics, quantum information technology, and artificial intelligence in China, Hong Kong, and Macao) have hindered the easing of tensions between China and the US. The CCP's feigned neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war has distanced Germany and the EU. The US-Japan-South Korea Trilateral Summit is accelerating the formation of an iron triangle, leaving the CCP feeling threatened. The dispute between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea has pushed ASEAN closer to the US.

For Xi, the more dangerous aspect is the turbulence in politics. Qin Gang, who was promoted rapidly, was removed from his position as Foreign Minister after only six months and has since disappeared; Li Shangfu disappeared after holding the position of Minister of National Defense for five months; senior officials of the Rocket Force have been implicated, possibly involving former Minister of National Defense Wei Fenghe and even current Military Commission members and vice chairmen. Doubts arise about Xi's control over the military. Moreover, political rumors abound, claiming that CCP elders and retired military officials (such as Zeng Qinghong, Chi Haotian, and Zhang Dejiang named by foreign media) are criticizing and pressuring Xi.

It can be said that Xi is now facing his most dangerous moment since taking office at the end of 2012. At the 19th National Congress, Xi was re-elected three times, eliminating all factions, and consolidating power under the Xi family's banner, seeming confident and ambitious. However, within just over half a year, the situation has dramatically reversed, and Xi's position is precarious.

Xi is very sensitive to crises. In the past year, Xi has occasionally disappeared and drastically reduced his overseas trips. Before the pandemic, Xi went abroad 14 times in a year, more than the US president; this year, he has only traveled twice, even missing the usual attendance at the G20 Summit.

Why? Xi is concerned about his personal safety and fears a palace coup. Let's discuss one detail. In this reception, according to official Chinese media video footage, there was a "male waiter" standing behind Xi, looking serious and scanning the room. None of the other leaders had such a "male waiter" following them. It is widely believed that this "male waiter" is actually Xi's bodyguard. Checking past National Day receptions, during Hu Jintao's tenure, only female waiters were seen around him during toasts. It seems that the use of "male waiters" at major meetings occurred after Xi Jinping came to power.

Xi's nervousness about his personal safety is related to his belief in ancient Chinese prophecies. Chinese civilization is ancient and profound, and prophecies are one of its essences. The most famous prophecy, the "Tui Bei Tu," is remarkably accurate. Xi believes that his fate is also in it. For example, the 46th image of the prophecy reads: "A soldier with a bow, claiming to be an old man with white hair. A golden sword lurks inside the eastern gate, brave warriors enter the imperial palace from the back door." Xi understands this as his demise due to a coup. (See the author's article "Can Xi Jinping 'Change Destiny'?")


Since the 19th National Congress, the political situation has been unpredictable, and the situation has become increasingly difficult. Xi Jinping's sense of crisis is growing stronger, his suspicion is increasing, and his vigilance is becoming stricter, and his actions are becoming more ruthless.

While intimidating all parties, Xi also needs to show to all sectors: I am in charge of the overall situation, everything is under control. Therefore, at this critical moment in China's political situation, Xi used this National Day reception to declare, "On the new journey, our future is bright, but the road ahead is not smooth." He urged everyone to follow him and "overcome difficulties and obstacles."


Moreover, on October 1st, Xi Jinping published an article titled "Advancing China's Modernization Requires Handling Several Major Relationships Well" in "Seeking Truth," the central theoretical publication of the CCP. The article mentions six sets of relationships, including the relationship between top-level design and practical exploration, the relationship between strategy and tactics, the relationship between adherence and innovation, the relationship between efficiency and fairness, the relationship between vitality and order, and the relationship between self-reliance and opening up, resembling Mao Zedong's "On Ten Relationships."


In February of this year, Xi Jinping spoke at a special seminar for newly appointed Central Committee members, alternate members, and leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels. Xi seemed to embody a master of dialectics and methodology, far-sighted, guiding the entire party. Choosing this time to publish the article implies: I have explained everything clearly, you need to understand and do it well. If you can't do it well, it's your ability problem, not mine. I will punish you.


Reality is becoming increasingly dangerous, and the country is rapidly declining. Yet, Xi portrays himself as an outstanding leader. This not only does nothing to help the situation but also has a negative effect. Xi's powerful measures include arresting people without explanation and pervasive surveillance, which has made the power elite feel insecure, everyone is in fear, and the ultimate result is to force anti-Xi forces to unite and rise up to overthrow Xi.


From the current situation, Xi Jinping is facing internal and external troubles, and is at a loss. He is heading towards the fate predicted in the prophecy.
