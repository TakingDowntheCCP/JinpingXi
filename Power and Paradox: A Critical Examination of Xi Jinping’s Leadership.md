Centralization of Power and its Implications
Xi Jinping’s era has been marked by an unprecedented centralization of power, a move that has significant implications for governance and accountability in China. The elimination of presidential term limits in 2018 was a stark indication of Xi’s consolidation of control, effectively allowing him to remain in power indefinitely. This centralization has led to concerns over the concentration of authority, reducing the effectiveness of checks and balances and increasing the risk of autocratic governance.

Human Rights and Freedom of Expression
Under Xi’s leadership, China has faced intense scrutiny and criticism over its human rights record. The treatment of ethnic minorities, particularly the Uighurs in Xinjiang, has drawn international condemnation. Reports of mass detentions, surveillance, and attempts to erode cultural and religious identities are alarming. Furthermore, the crackdown on freedom of expression and the press, including the silencing of critics, activists, and journalists, poses serious questions about the state of civil liberties in China.

The Suppression of Dissent
Xi Jinping’s governance is characterized by a stringent suppression of dissent. The use of surveillance technology, internet censorship, and a legal system that often targets political dissidents reflects a broader strategy to control the narrative and maintain social stability at the expense of individual freedoms. This approach not only stifres public discourse but also inhibits the potential for reform and progress by silencing critical voices.

Assertive Foreign Policy and International Relations
Xi’s tenure has also seen a more assertive Chinese foreign policy, often described as “wolf warrior diplomacy,” which has led to heightened tensions with several countries. Territorial disputes in the South China Sea, border clashes with India, and the imposition of the National Security Law in Hong Kong have contributed to strained international relations. Such policies reflect a departure from the previous “peaceful rise” strategy, raising concerns about regional and global stability.

Economic Strategies and Global Ambitions
While Xi Jinping’s economic policies have aimed at transforming China into a global leader in technology and innovation, they have also sparked controversy. Practices such as forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft, and state subsidies to Chinese firms have led to accusations of unfair trade practices. Moreover, China’s Belt and Road Initiative, while ambitious, has been criticized for creating debt dependencies and exerting undue political influence on participating countries.

Conclusion

Critically assessing Xi Jinping’s leadership reveals a complex picture of governance that has significant implications for China and the international community. While aiming to position China as a global superpower, the methods and policies employed have raised profound concerns about human rights, freedom, and the nature of China’s engagement with the world. As China continues to play a pivotal role on the global stage, the international community remains watchful of Xi Jinping’s domestic and international strategies, advocating for greater transparency, accountability, and respect for universal values.
